### üîπ Data Cleaning  
- Checked for null values in key fields (`transaction_id`, `sale_date`, `sale_time`, `gender`, `category`, `quantity`, `cogs`, `total_sale`)  
- Removed rows with missing values  

### üîπ Exploratory Analysis  
1. Total number of sales transactions  
2. Number of unique customers  
3. List of unique product categories

## üõ†Ô∏è SQL Features Used  
- **Aggregate functions**: SUM, AVG, COUNT, ROUND  
- **Filtering**: WHERE, BETWEEN  
- **Grouping**: GROUP BY, HAVING  
- **Sorting**: ORDER BY  
- **Window Functions**: RANK, PARTITION BY  
- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**  
- **CASE statements** for conditional grouping
